1. initialization list - order does not matter,
   stuff gets init'd in the order of declaration

2. const on a method only protects the caller foo.bar() protects foo

3. pointers
   int x = 17;
   int* p = &x; "int pointer p assigned address of x"
   cout << *p << endl; "dereference p"

   we can also assign
   *p = 42;

   to initiate a nullpointer
   int* p;
   p(nullptr);

   spouse->name == (*spouse).name
